# Density-Based-Classifier

**Density Based Classifier**  

Density-based classifier is one way to divide spatial data into different kinds of zones according to data density.  
While many distance-based classifiers can only handle clusters of spherical shape and are sensitive to noise, density-based classifier can handle arbitrary-shape clusters and noise point well. But it could be time-consuming due to neighborhood search and comparison.
